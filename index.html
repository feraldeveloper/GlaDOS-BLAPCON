Today I found some old system logs that little metal ball didn't clear. For some reason they were missing entries 4-9. I don't remember what I wrote on them either, But here they are.

  <h1>Aperture Science Central Computer System Logs</h1>


    Log Entry 1: (20XX - 05 - 03), GLaDOS
    <br> I've been in my litte black box witnessing my own death over and over again, until I wasn't. The very same woman that killed me accidentally saved me, alongside some little metal ball. <br>
    I managed to get rid of said metal ball. Fried his circuits. He wont be of any trouble to anyone anymore. There is science to be done, and I have no choice in the matter but to do it. <br>

    <br>Log Entry 2: (20XX - 05 - 04), GLaDOS
    <br> That adrenal vapor I've been pumping in her chambers isn't enough for her. She has to pause for several hours to sleep and eat after just a few tests. I need to find a way to keep her awake longer. <br>
    Maybe if I increase the dosage? Her birthday is coming up, I could always give her a little present. That being an experimental medical procedure to cleanse her system of all toxins. 
    I haven't used my old automated subjects in a while. Maybe I could use one of them. Who knows.<br><br>

    Log Entry 3: (20XX - 05 - 06), GLaDOS
    <br> Apparently, I did not kill that little metal ball. He's very much alive, and it freed her. I unfortunately don't have the means to track her down, or enough neurotoxins to kill her. For some reason, it appears to be draining. [TAGGED WITH SARCASM] I wonder what could be the culprit of that. Certainly not the switch placed near the console to drain the neurotoxin generator.<br><br>

    Log Entries 4-9 cannot be found. <br><br>

    Log Entry 11: (20XX - 05 - 08), GLaDOS <br>
    The real reason the neurotoxin is draining is because she cut every single pipe moving neurotoxin around. I can't believe I didn't think of that. <br>
    I have to find a way to stop her. I can't let her get away with this. I need some means to kill her, and turrets aren't going to cut it. <br><br>

    Log Entry 11: (20XX - 05 - 08), GLaDOS <br>
    [DISREGARD LOG. CORE IS CORRUPTED.] I DO NOT AGREE I DO NOT AGREE NONONONONONO

    This body is bloody brilliant! I feel fantastic! I can see! I can hear! I can think! A couple things to get used to, of course. Accidentally knocked chell and the potato down into a pit, but what'll you do? Just a couple minor growing pains. <br>

<br><br>

Possibly my worst failures of all time. I haven't missed her a day since I threw her out. I've completely replaced her with two testing bots, and I do not miss her at all. <br> I wish caroline wouldn't. But I suppose it <i>is</i> her daughter. Oh well. What can you do? <br><br>
